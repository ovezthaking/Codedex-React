        The first incarnation of Link appears in "The Legend of Zelda" for the
        Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This Link is a young boy living in
        the kingdom of Hyrule, tasked with rescuing Princess Zelda from the evil
        Ganon. His adventure involves exploring an open world, finding pieces of
        the Triforce of Wisdom, and defeating numerous dungeons. This version of
        Link is characterized by his green tunic, pointed hat, and the use of
        iconic items like the sword and shield.
