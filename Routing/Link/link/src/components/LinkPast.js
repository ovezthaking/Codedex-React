        In "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" for the Super Nintendo
        Entertainment System (SNES), Link is depicted as a more developed hero
        living with his uncle. He is drawn into a quest to rescue Princess Zelda
        and thwart the evil wizard Agahnim, who is attempting to release Ganon
        from imprisonment. This Link journeys between the Light World and the
        Dark World, wielding the Master Sword for the first time and collecting
        various magical items. This version is noted for his more detailed
        design and expanded backstory.
