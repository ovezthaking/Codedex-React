      <p>
        "A Link Between Worlds" for the Nintendo 3DS features a new Link in a
        world that is a direct sequel to "A Link to the Past." This Link can
        merge into walls as a 2D painting, a unique ability that allows him to
        navigate puzzles and explore dungeons in innovative ways. The game
        features a similar art style and overworld to its predecessor but
        introduces new mechanics and a fresh storyline involving the parallel
        kingdom of Lorule. This Link is characterized by his courage and
        adaptability, tackling a variety of challenges in both Hyrule and
        Lorule.
